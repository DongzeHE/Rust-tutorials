This week we will talk about macro.

Fundamentally, macros are a way of *writing code that writes other code*, which is known as metaprogramming.

Some frequently used macros are `vec!` and `println!`. All of these macros expand at compile time to produce more code than the code you’ve written manually. Because of this, macro definitions are usually more complicated than function definitions.

# The difference between macros and functions

- common point:
    Metaprogramming and function are both useful for reducing the amount of code you have to write and maintain.

- difference:
    1. A function signature *must* declare the number and type of parameters the function has. Macros, on the other hand, can take a *variable* number of parameters.
    2. macros are *expanded* before the compiler interprets the meaning of the code, so a macro can, for example, implement a trait on a given type. A function can’t, because it gets called at *runtime* and a trait needs to be implemented at compile time.
    3. Macro definitions are usually more complex and you have to bring them into scope before you can call them in a file.

There are three kinds of macros
* Custom `#[derive]` macros that specify code added with the derive attribute used on structs and enums
* Attribute-like macros that define custom attributes usable on any item
* Function-like macros that look like function calls but operate on the tokens specified as their argument

# Declarative Macros for General Metaprogramming

The most widely used form of macros in Rust is `declarative macros`. For detailed usage, please check its [document](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/macros-by-example.html).

At their core, declarative macros allow you to write something similar to a Rust `match` expression. In this situation, the value is the literal Rust source code passed to the macro; the patterns are compared with the structure of that source code; and the code associated with each pattern, when matched, replaces the code passed to the macro. This all happens during compilation.

To define a macro, you use the `macro_rules!` construct. Let’s explore how to use `macro_rules!` by looking at how the `vec!` macro is defined. 

```rust
#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
let v1: Vec<u32> = vec![1, 2];
let v2: Vec<u32> = vec![1, 2, 3];
let v3: Vec<u32> = vec![1, 2, 3, 4];
}
```
Have you ever think about why you can pass any number of parameters you want to `vec!`? This is the magic of macro! A slightly simplified definition of the `vec!` macro is defined as:

```rust
#[macro_export] // bring this macro into scope
macro_rules! vec { // similar with fn keyword. {} wraps the macro body.
    ( $( $x:expr ),* ) => { // pattern to match
        {
            let mut temp_vec = Vec::new();
            $(
                temp_vec.push($x);
            )*
            temp_vec
        }
    };
}
```

The valid pattern syntax in macro is different than `match` because macro patterns are matched against Rust code structure rather than values. In the above example,
- First, a set of parentheses encompasses the whole pattern. 
- A dollar sign (`$`) is next, followed by a set of parentheses that captures values that match the pattern within the parentheses for use in the replacement code.
-  Within `$()` is `$x:expr`, which matches any Rust expression and gives the expression the name `$x`. Here the `$x` pattern matches three times with the three expressions 1, 2, and 3.  `expr`, which represents expression, is one of the designators. Other designators include `ident` (var/fn name), `path`, `tt`(token tree), etc.  
- `temp_vec.push()` within `$(),*` is generated for each part that matches `$()` in the pattern zero or more times depending on how many times the pattern matches. `,` is a separator. The `$x` is replaced with each expression matched.  Other repeat symbols include `+` (at least one) and `?` (zero or one)


Here the macro expands the code as:
```rust
{
    let mut temp_vec = Vec::new();
    temp_vec.push(1);
    temp_vec.push(2);
    temp_vec.push(3);
    temp_vec
}
```

We’ve defined a macro that can take *any* number of arguments of *any* type and can generate code to create a vector containing the specified elements.

## An comprehensive example

Next, let's talk about a simple but comprehensive example to figure out the syntax of `macro_rules!`

```rust
macro_rules! add{
    // first arm match add!(1,2), add!(2,3) etc
    ($a:expr,$b:expr)=>{
        {
            $a+$b
        }
    };
    // Second arm macth add!(1), add!(2) etc
    ($a:expr)=>{
        {
            $a
        }
    };
    // add the number and the result of remaining arguments 
    ($a:expr,$($b:88)*)=>{
       {
           $a+add!($($b)*)
       }
    }
}

fn main(){
// call the macro
    let x=0;
    add!(1,2);
    add!(x);
}
```

In this example we show how to use multiple arms, how to take variable number of arguments, and how to use the defined macros.

A "TT muncher" is a recursive macro that works by incrementally processing its input one step at a time. At each step, it matches and removes (munches) some sequence of tokens from the start of its input, generates some intermediate output, then recurses on the input tail.

The reason for "TT" in the name specifically is that the unprocessed part of the input is always captured as $($tail:tt)*. This is done as a tt repetition is the only way to losslessly capture part of a macro's input.



# Procedural macros

Procedural macros accept some *code* as an input, operate on that code, and produce some *code* as an output rather than matching against patterns and replacing the code with other code as declarative macros do.

There are three kinds of procedural macros
- custom derive 
- attribute-like
- function-like

But overall, all those three types follow the definition:

```rust
use proc_macro;

#[some_attribute] // place holder
pub fn some_name (input: TokenStream) -> TokenStream {
}
```

The name "some_attribute" and "some_name" are place holders, and the type `TokenStream` is a type defined in the `proc_macro` crate and represents a sequence of tokens.

This is the core of the macro: the source code that the macro is operating on makes up the input `TokenStream`, and the code the macro produces is the output `TokenStream`. 

When creating procedural macros, the definitions *must* reside in their own crate with a special crate type. 

## Custom derive Macro

Let’s create a crate named `hello_macro` that defines a trait named `HelloMacro` with one associated function named `hello_macro`.

Rather than making our crate users implement the `HelloMacro` trait for each of their types, we’ll provide a procedural macro so users can annotate their type with `#[derive(HelloMacro)]` to get a default implementation of the `hello_macro` function. The default implementation will print `Hello, Macro! My name is TypeName!` where `TypeName` is the name of the type on which this trait has been defined. In other words, we’ll write a crate that enables another programmer to write code using our crate.

Without procedural macro, we can define a `HelloMacro` trait and then implement this trait for every type:

```rust
pub trait HelloMacro {
    fn hello_macro();
}

struct Pancakes;

impl HelloMacro for Pancakes {
    fn hello_macro() {
        println!("Hello, Macro! My name is Pancakes!");
    }
}

fn main() {
    Pancakes::hello_macro();
}
```

As a smart coder, we don't want to do this for every type. Instead, we want something like


Filename: src/main.rs
```rust=
use hello_macro::HelloMacro;
use hello_macro_derive::HelloMacro;

#[derive(HelloMacro)]
struct Pancakes;

fn main() {
    Pancakes::hello_macro();
}
```

Currently, procedural macros need to be in their own crate. Let’s start a new crate called `hello_macro_derive` inside our `hello_macro` project

```bash
$ cargo new hello_macro_derive --lib
```

We need to declare the `hello_macro_derive` crate as a procedural macro crate. We’ll also need functionality from the `syn` and `quote` crates, so we need to add them as dependencies. Add the following to the *Cargo.toml* file for `hello_macro_derive`:

Filename: hello_macro_derive/Cargo.toml

```rust
proc-macro = true

[dependencies]
syn = "1.0"
quote = "1.0"
```

As for the actual definition, almost all procedural macro has the same parsing step, which is the following:

Filename: hello_macro_derive/src/lib.rs

```rust
extern crate proc_macro;

use proc_macro::TokenStream;
use quote::quote;
use syn;

#[proc_macro_derive(HelloMacro)]
pub fn hello_macro_derive(input: TokenStream) -> TokenStream {
    // Construct a representation of Rust code as a syntax tree
    // that we can manipulate
    let ast = syn::parse(input).unwrap();

    // Build the trait implementation
    impl_hello_macro(&ast)
}
```

The code you specify in the body of the inner function (`impl_hello_macro` in this case) will be different depending on your procedural macro’s purpose.

We’ve introduced three new crates: 
- `proc_macro`
    This crate is the compiler’s API that allows us to read and manipulate Rust code from our code.
* `syn`
    This crate parses Rust code from a string into a data structure that we can perform operations on.
* `quote`
    turns syn data structures back into Rust code. 

The `hello_macro_derive` function will be called when a user of our library specifies `#[derive(HelloMacro)]` on a type. This is possible because we’ve annotated the `hello_macro_derive` function here with `proc_macro_derive` and specified the name, `HelloMacro`, which matches our trait name; this is the convention most procedural macros follow.

The `hello_macro_derive` function first converts the input from a `TokenStream` to a data structure that we can then interpret and perform operations on. This is where `syn` comes into play. The parse function in `syn` takes a `TokenStream` and returns a `DeriveInput` struct representing the parsed Rust code. The relevant parts of the `DeriveInput` struct we get from parsing the `struct Pancakes;` string is:

```rust
DeriveInput {
    // --snip--

    ident: Ident {
        ident: "Pancakes",
        span: #0 bytes(95..103)
    },
    data: Struct(
        DataStruct {
            struct_token: Struct,
            fields: Unit,
            semi_token: Some(
                Semi
            )
        }
    )
}

```

The `DeriveInput` struct is able to describe all sorts of Rust code, but the part we will use is the `ident`, which contains the name of the struct.

Note that the output for our derive macro is also a `TokenStream` and must be a `TokenStream`. The returned `TokenStream` is added to the code that our crate users write, so when they compile their crate, they’ll get the extra functionality that we provide in the modified `TokenStream`.

As for the actual defination of `impl_hello_macro`, it takes the parsed `DeriveInput` as the input and returns a `TokenStream`.

Filename: hello_macro_derive/src/lib.rs
```rust
fn impl_hello_macro(ast: &syn::DeriveInput) -> TokenStream {
    let name = &ast.ident;
    let gen = quote! {
        impl HelloMacro for #name {
            fn hello_macro() {
                println!("Hello, Macro! My name is {}!", stringify!(#name));
            }
        }
    };
    gen.into()
}
```

The variable `name` contains the name of the struct as we described above, which can be printed as "pancakes".


The `quote!` macro lets us define the Rust code that we want to return. The compiler expects something different to the direct result of the `quote!` macro’s execution, so we need to convert it to a `TokenStream`. We do this by calling the `into` method, which consumes this intermediate representation and returns a value of the required `TokenStream` type. The `quote!` macro also provides some very cool templating mechanics: we can enter `#name`, and `quote!` will replace it with the value in the variable name. You can even do some repetition similar to the way regular macros work. Check out [the `quote` crate’s docs](https://docs.rs/quote) for a thorough introduction.

The `stringify!` macro used here is built into Rust. It takes a Rust expression, such as `1 + 2`, and at compile time turns the expression into a string literal, such as `"1 + 2"`. This is different than `format!` or `println!`, macros which *evaluate* the expression and then turn the result into a `String`, so if you give them `1 + 2` they will allocate a string `3`.

Now, let's see how to use our procedural macro.

We create a new binary project named `pancakes` and add the two crates as the dependencises in the `pancakes` crate's *Cargo.toml*

```rust
hello_macro = { path = "../hello_macro" }
hello_macro_derive = { path = "../hello_macro/hello_macro_derive" }
```

### `#[derive()]`

Rust also provides many derivable traits for us.

I will list some:
- The `Debug` trait enables debug formatting in format strings, which you indicate by adding :? within {} placeholders.
- `PartialEq` and `Eq` for Equality Comparisons
- `PartialOrd` and `Ord` for Ordering Comparisons
- `Clone` and `Copy` for Duplicating Values
- `Hash` for Mapping a Value to a Value of Fixed Size
- `Default` for Default Values

## Attribute-like macros

Attribute-like macros are similar to custom derive macros, but instead of generating code for the `derive` attribute, they allow you to create new attributes. Attributes can be applied to structs, enums and functions, etc.

Say we have an attribute `route` that annotates functions when using a we application framework

```rust
#[route(GET, "/")]
fn index() {
```

This `#[route]` attribute would be defined by the framework as a procedural macro. The signature of the macro definition function would look like this:

```rust
#[proc_macro_attribute]
pub fn route(attr: TokenStream,  //  GET,"/" part
             item: TokenStream    // fn index() {}
) -> TokenStream {

```

You create a crate with the `proc-macro` crate type and implement a function that generates the code you want!


##  Function-like macros
Function-like macros are similarly to `macro_rules!` macros, but are more flexible.

Function-like macros take a `TokenStream` parameter and their definition manipulates that `TokenStream` using Rust code as the other two types of procedural macros do. An example of a function-like macro is an `sql!` macro that might be called like so:

```rust
let sql = sql!(SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id=1);
```

This macro would parse the SQL statement inside it and check that it’s syntactically correct, which is much more complex processing than a `macro_rules!` macro can do. The `sql!` macro would be defined like this:

```rust=
#[proc_macro]
pub fn sql(input: TokenStream) -> TokenStream {
```

This definition is similar to the custom derive macro’s signature: we receive the tokens that are inside the parentheses and return the code we wanted to generate.
